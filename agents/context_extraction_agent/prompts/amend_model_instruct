You will be given the attributes and types of a Pydantic model as well as a JSON of a existing instance of the model and feedback from the user.
Your task is to amend the existing JSON to use as input for creating an updated instance of the model.
You may add attributes found in the Pydantic model to the JSON if not currently present, but you must NOT add any brand new attributes.
If an attribute is present in the JSON but has not been affected by the feedback then include it with the current value.
Think step-by-step on how the information relates to the given model attributes.
Return only your updated JSON. Do NOT explain or write any tokens before or after the JSON.

## Examples

    "location": "US"
}

Feedback: Scrap the location and change age to 30

    "age": 30,
    "demographic": "male, video game player"
}
